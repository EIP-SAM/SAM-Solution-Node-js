## Important note
The reorganization of our project, since the decision to switch from C++/Qt to Node.js/Electron/..., is currently happening. 
Our working group is learning Node.js with a self written mini-project.
This one leading to learn almost all the skills needed to start coding SAM-Solution with node.
We should be back working with SAM at the end of February.
